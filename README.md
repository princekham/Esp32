## Issues
Patthanawit Tumboon

From actual use for 1 full year. I have a problem, but a few. For example.

* Water pump is stuck because it is a system of fueang. Fix the fever by removing it and cleaning it.

* The visual signal is loose, but we use RTK system. The precision of the flight will be very stable. (RTK is free for

lifetime)

* I used to fly by myself. When I use it, I

feel weird. But it's more comfortable, not tired. 100% about sowing. I have sown for 15

tons, but I still haven't seen any disadvantages.

Secondly, you will feel that the problem is much less stingy.
